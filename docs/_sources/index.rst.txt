AI-Trainer is a toolbox that defines multiple exciting simplifications to your workflow:

- A dataset format that allows to group several properties (images) for one entity
- A labelling tool that helps gives us AI-assisted proposals for unlabelled data
- Data generators that actually work without further modification to train your own models!

This page only contain hand-written tutorials and explanations,
the docstrings are available in the corresponding code.
