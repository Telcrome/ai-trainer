AI-Trainer is a toolbox that defines multiple simplifications to your workflow:

- A dataset format that allows to group several properties (e.g. images) for one entity (e.g. a medical patient)
- A labelling tool that helps us using AI-assisted proposals for unlabelled data, given what is already labelled!
- Data generators that actually work without further modification to train your own models!
- A few-shot learning framework that does not require gradient descent
