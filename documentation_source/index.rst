AI-Trainer is a toolbox that defines multiple exciting simplifications to your workflow:

- A dataset format that allows to group several properties (e.g. images) for one entity (e.g. a medical patient)
- A labelling tool that helps us with AI-assisted proposals for unlabelled data
- Data generators that actually work without further modification to train your own models!
